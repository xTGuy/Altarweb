<h1 id="havoc-">Havoc://</h1>
<p>Welcome to Havoc! Havoc is a web protocol that is supposed to be a easy way to browse the web. The Havoc protocol supports use for our own &quot;Coding Language&quot; called GoScript. It is just a python library made for interacting with the havoc protocol and websites. (Note: We are working on a package manager for GoScript called gopm (GoScript Package manager) so you can install libraries made for GoScript.)</p>
<h1 id="making-a-domain">Making a domain</h1>
<p>Making a domain is not automated yet. A Havoc domain is completely free forever. And <strong>NO</strong> domain hosters. To get a domain, you have to email havoc@altarweb.com telling the domain name, and what the IP is for the hosting you use. If you are looking at the domains confused that some of the domains are hosted directly on the repo, it&#39;s because I made the websites.</p>
